Title:
Automatic Test-Case Generation Based on Component Descriptions for Open Adaptive Systems

-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Short Description:
The rise of smart eco systems, which combine several systems to new system of systems, put new challenges on the verification and validation (V&V) of such systems.
Especially safety critical systems require a sound V&V to ensure that unacceptable risks are excluded as well as to provide evidence, that the system is allowed to be operated.
Due to the possibilities to connect new devices at runtime, the number of possible configurations explodes.
The large set of possible usages among their interactions cannot be analyzed anymore upfront during the design time. Hence, new techniques are required to enable the V&V at runtime.
The proposed Thesis should work out a design for a reference architecture for a set of usage scenarios.
The architecture should enable the safe integration of components at runtime.
Based on a prototype implementation the proposed solution should be evaluated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
The model should be constructed from the components we have.
The environment in which it is running is related to the components.

For each safety goal fulfilment: bring evidence verification/validation.
We will use human based reasoning in the verification part, if the configuration is valid.

We consider that the system has interfaces in place, with formal descriptions and formal specifications.

Metrics to be evaluated:
    transitions ceoverage
    specs coverage

We assume that we already have unit testing in place.
We need a form of assesment of how much the already in place documentation offers information about
the testing environments, classes and runtime entities.

Description of the system and starting points of the actual research:
    We have a model based system.
    The statical analysis has been already completed.
    The components have already been tested.
    The configuration can be mapped:
        as a connection between variuos nodes (vertices) of the system
        as a state machine
    Some configuration combinations can never happen.
    Respect the IEC 61408 Standard?
    We have a component feedback loop in some scenarios.
    Every component in the system has a standardized interface.
    We may have shared variables in the system.
    Some states in the system can never be reached.

We need to take into account:
    HRA - Possible hazards
    Safety requirements
    SIL-ISIL Safety Integrity Level
    Validity of the integration tests we do not know the environment
    Label transition systems

My contribution:
    Fixed set of test cases -- measure their level of completness
    Devise system level test cases
    System level validation
    Generate system level test cases
    Create a prototype project and use mocks to implement it
    Inter-connect the components
    Simulate the running project
    Test coverage definition in terms of safety (critical situation)
    Branch/loop coverage when it comes to validation
